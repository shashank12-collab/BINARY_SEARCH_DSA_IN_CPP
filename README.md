# 🔍 Binary Search – DSA in C++

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains **C++ implementations** of **Binary Search** and its various **applications in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It aims to help beginners and intermediate programmers understand how binary search can be applied to solve a wide range of problems efficiently.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
Binary Search isn’t just about searching a number in a sorted array — it’s a *pattern* used in many logical and mathematical problems.  
This repo covers:

- Basic Binary Search  
- Finding first and last occurrence  
- Implementing lower and upper bounds  
- Searching in rotated sorted arrays  
- Finding kth and median elements from sorted arrays  
- Searching within a 2D matrix  
- Optimizing answers using binary search (on the solution space)

## 📂 Files Description

### 🧩 `binary_search.cpp`
Basic implementation of binary search algorithm on a sorted array.

### 🧩 `first_last_occurrence.cpp`
Finds the first and last occurrence of a target element using modified binary search.

### 🧩 `lower_bound.cpp`
Implements a custom version of the **lower bound** function (smallest index where value ≥ target).

### 🧩 `upper_bound.cpp`
Implements **upper bound** (smallest index where value > target).

### 🧩 `search_rotated.cpp`
Performs binary search in a rotated sorted array.

### 🧩 `kth_2sorted.cpp`
Finds the k-th element in two sorted arrays using binary search logic.

### 🧩 `median_two_sorted_array.cpp`
Finds the median of two sorted arrays.

### 🧩 `rows_max_ones.cpp`
Finds the row with the maximum number of 1’s in a binary matrix.

### 🧩 `search_matrix.cpp`
Searches a target value in a 2D matrix using binary search approach.
